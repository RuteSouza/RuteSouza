# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"/>
My name is Rute, I'am from Bahia and currently living in SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. Some of my hobbies are riding a bike, reading books (Fiction and investigative books are favorites), and I also enjoy doing outdoors exercises. My favorite TV show is The Simpsons and my number one place to relax and spend the time off is always at the beach.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming and taking classes on HTML, CSS, JavaScrip and I am looking to collaborate on projects to develop and improve my knowledges.
- ðŸ“« You can find me on my social medias: biolinky.co/rutesouza
