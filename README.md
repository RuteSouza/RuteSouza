# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"/>
You can call me Rute or Ruth (many foreigners have difficulty pronouncing my name with the "e" at the end, so I accept the version with "h" lol). I was born in Bahia but I am now living in SÃ£o Paulo-Brazil. Some of my hobbies are riding a bike and reading books (fiction and literature are my favorites), and I also enjoy doing outdoor exercises. My number one place to relax and spend time off is always at the beach. I love to travel too. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying software development and am very interested in the front-end field... I am looking to collaborate on projects and improve my skills. Please be patient with me; I am a newbie to all this tech stuff. ðŸ™ƒ
- ðŸ“« You can find me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rutesouza/"> LinkedIn</a>.
